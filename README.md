# Simple Weather App (PyQt5)

A simple Python GUI application that checks the current weather of any city using the **OpenWeatherMap API**.  
Built with **PyQt5** for the interface, **Requests** for API calls, and **NumPy** for temperature conversion.  
This project is part of my journey into building Python applications that combine **APIs**, **GUI development**, and **data handling**.
