# Simple Weather App (PyQt5)
A simple Python GUI application that checks the current weather of any city using the **OpenWeatherMap API**.  
![Weather App Screenshot](Weather_app_ss.png)
Built with **PyQt5** for the interface, **Requests** for API calls, **NumPy** for temperature conversion, and **Pandas** for weather history management.  
This project is part of my journey into building Python applications that combine **APIs**, **GUI development**, and **data handling**.
